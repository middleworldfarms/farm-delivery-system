# DELIVERY SCHEDULE INTEGRATION - FINAL STATUS REPORT

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

### üéØ **CURRENT CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (June 13, 2025)**

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Delivery schedule for active paying members receiving boxes

**TAB STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS**:
- **All 3 tabs (All, Deliveries, Collections) must function identically**
- **Default view: ACTIVE subscriptions only** (most important - for box day)
- **Status subtabs under each main tab**: Active, On Hold, Pending, Cancelled, etc.
- **Week navigation**: Scroll through weeks to see schedule
- **Active subscribers**: Primary concern - getting boxes out to paying members
- **Other statuses**: Available but secondary (for admin review on non-box days)

**DATA REQUIREMENTS**:
- Only show **subscriptions** (`shop_subscription`) - not one-time orders
- Status should NOT determine delivery/collection - only `post_type` matters
- All subscriptions appear regardless of status, but filtered by status subtabs
- Frequency: Weekly or Fortnightly (from subscription meta, not billing)

### üîß **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE WORKING**
- ‚úÖ Direct database connection to WordPress/WooCommerce
- ‚úÖ `DirectDatabaseService` with proper subscription queries
- ‚úÖ Week navigation UI components
- ‚úÖ Status-based filtering and counting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX**
- All tab shows nothing (should show active subscriptions for current week)
- Deliveries tab empty (should show same data as Collections but that's incorrect)
- Only Collections tab working correctly
- Need to clarify: All tabs should show subscriptions, not separate delivery types

### üìù **IMPORTANT NOTES**
- **STOP UNDOING WORKING FUNCTIONALITY**
- When tabs work correctly, document the exact code
- Default to Active status for all tabs (box day priority)
- This project keeps losing progress - maintain this status file
