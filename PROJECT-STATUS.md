# MWF Admin Panel Project Status
*Last Updated: June 7, 2025*

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO ADDRESS
- **Git commits being lost** - Only 2 commits exist when multiple were made
- **Work being undone repeatedly** - Pattern of losing progress
- **No clear documentation** of what's working vs broken
- **User switching integration incomplete** - Main project goal not achieved

## CURRENT WORKING STATE ✅
### What Actually Works Right Now:
1. **Delivery Schedule Page**: `https://admin.middleworldfarms.org/admin/deliveries`
   - Shows 4 deliveries and 15 collections
   - Real WooCommerce subscription data loading
   - API connection test now passes
   - Week A/B logic working

### Files Currently Working:
- `resources/views/admin/deliveries/index.blade.php` (restored from fixed.blade.php)
- `app/Services/DeliveryScheduleService.php` (API connection fixed)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/DeliveryController.php`
- `routes/web.php` (basic delivery routes)

## LOST FUNCTIONALITY ❌
### What We Had Before But Lost:
1. **User Switching Integration** - Was previously working in delivery tables
2. **Multiple Git commits** - Only 2 remain when there were more
3. **Advanced partials** - delivery-table.blade.php and collection-table.blade.php with user switching
4. **Complete user switching service** - May exist but not integrated

## USER SWITCHING API STATUS - TESTED ✅
### API Test Results (June 7, 2025):

1. **WooCommerce Customers API** ✅ WORKING
   - Endpoint: `/wp-json/wc/v3/customers`
   - Auth: Basic Auth (Consumer Key/Secret)
   - Status: 200 OK - Returns customer data

2. **MWF Custom API** ❌ NOT FOUND
   - Endpoint: `/wp-json/mwf/v1/users`
   - Auth: X-WC-API-Key header
   - Status: 404 - "No route was found"

3. **WordPress Users API** (Not tested yet)
   - Endpoint: `/wp-json/wp/v2/users`

### CONCLUSION:
**We must use WooCommerce Customers API for user switching** - it's the only confirmed working endpoint.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:
1. ✅ **Test APIs** - COMPLETED
2. **Update MWFUserSwitchingService to use WooCommerce API**
3. **Create minimal user switching button prototype**
4. **Test user switching URL generation**
5. **Integrate into delivery tables**

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. **Audit existing user switching files**
2. **Test API endpoints to confirm which works**
3. **Document working API calls**
4. **Create minimal working user switching prototype**
5. **Commit each step individually**

## FILES TO INVESTIGATE
- `app/Services/MWFUserSwitchingService.php` (exists, need to check)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserSwitchingController.php` (exists, need to check)
- `app/Services/WordPressUserService.php` (exists, need to check)

## PROJECT GOAL
**Add user switching buttons to delivery schedule tables** - positioned under customer names, not in separate Actions column, for faster admin workflow.
